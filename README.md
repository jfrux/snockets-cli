#Snockets Command-line Interface
This is a CLI for the Snockets node app.

###I'm a n00b...
First off, this is my first Node.js app.  I suck at it and it totally feels slopped together.

I'm certain it could be better but I wanted to get a "proof of concept" out there to see if I could even pull it off without any prior node experience.

###Why make a Snockets CLI?
It was written so that you can use Snockets as a simple asset bundler / dependency manager for any web app or other application.
It's meant to be a nice cross-platform solution because when I've tried to make Sprockets (ruby) work in my environment across multiple platforms I've had some troubles.
